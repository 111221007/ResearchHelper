"In childhood and adolescence periods, individuals encounter many dangerous situations caused by not completing their biological and psychological development. Some of them are pathological deaths such as accidents, poisoning, and traumatic actions for children. Awareness of the number and causes of death is an indicator that reflects the health status of our society. It is also vital in-service planning for both preventive and therapeutic medical professions. The purpose of this article is to evaluate death cases between the ages of 0–18 in terms of forensic medicine. As a result, it has been understood that accidents are an important cause of death in childhood. In particular, developing policies to protect against common accidents will reduce the mortality rates of children.",Semantic Scholar,Alper Keten,Various contributions mentioned in the paper,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_465_20,8,Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care,Limitations discussed in the paper,others,,3807,paper_001,Medknow,Death in childhood and adolescence: Accident!,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_465_20,9,2020,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"Road traffic accidents are associated with deaths due to different mechanisms. Loss of blood as a result of multiple injuries is the commonest in majority of cases. The severity of these injuries depends on the force of impact of a vehicle. The speed, type of car, and direction of impact are the main determining factors in causation of injuries.",Semantic Scholar,B.
