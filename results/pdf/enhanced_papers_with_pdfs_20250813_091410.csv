",,Explainable AI“ ist kein neues Gebiet. Vielmehr ist das Problem der Erklärbarkeit so alt wie die AI selbst, ja vielmehr das Resultat ihrer selbst. Während regelbasierte Lösungen der frühen AI nachvollziehbare ,,Glass-Box“-Ansätze darstellten, lag deren Schwäche im Umgang mit Unsicherheiten der realen Welt. Durch die Einführung probabilistischer Modellierung und statistischer Lernmethoden wurden die Anwendungen zunehmend erfolgreicher – aber immer komplexer und opak. Beispielsweise werden Wörter natürlicher Sprache auf hochdimensionale Vektoren abgebildet und dadurch für Menschen nicht mehr verstehbar. In Zukunft werden kontextadaptive Verfahren notwendig werden, die eine Verknüpfung zwischen statistischen Lernmethoden und großen Wissensrepräsentationen (Ontologien) herstellen und Nachvollziehbarkeit, Verständlichkeit und Erklärbarkeit erlauben – dem Ziel von ,,explainable AI“.",Andreas Holzinger,10.1007/s00287-018-1102-5,2,Informatik-Spektrum,138-143,paper_003,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Explainable AI (ex-AI),journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00287-018-1102-5,41.0,2018.0,Semantic Scholar,high,others,,Various contributions mentioned in the paper,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_003.pdf,Semantic Scholar,,1.74

"In fall 2014, we launched a foundational course in artificial intelligence (CS7637: Knowledge‐Based AI) as part of Georgia Institute of Technology's Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. We incorporated principles and practices from the cognitive and learning sciences into the development of the online AI course. We also integrated AI techniques into the instruction of the course, including embedding 100 highly focused intelligent tutoring agents in the video lessons. By now, more than 2000 students have taken the course. Evaluations have indicated that OMSCS students enjoy the course compared to traditional courses, and more importantly, that online students have matched residential students' performance on the same assessments. In this article, we present the design, delivery, and evaluation of the course, focusing on the use of AI for teaching AI. We also discuss lessons we learned for scaling the teaching and learning of AI.",Ashok K. Goel; David A.

"According to McCarthy, artificial intelligence (AI) is “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are highly biologically observable”. AI may play an imminent role in committing criminal acts in the future and these acts are called AI- crimes (AIC). AIC has posed a threat towards cybersecurity, a few of AIC are, a) theft of sensitive data from government and private organizations, b) hacked and weaponized autonomous weapons, c) social engineering attacks, d) disruption in the political arena, such as “misinformation” campaigns, etc. 
 
There is no regulatory framework at the moment which targets AI-crimes, majority of the stakeholder’s policy recommendations are targeted towards fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning or they target the R&D of robots, none of the legal texts cover the much-debated topic of criminal liability of an AI as the law is still undecided. The traditional method of regulation of AI has been by, product licensing, research and development oversight and tort liability. However, the current AI principles are not enough to determine the threat posed by AI acting autonomously in the future. 
 
The paper is going to be divided into four parts, the first part of the paper will be an introduction to the concept of Artificial Intelligence Crime (AIC) and plausible AI malicious actions. The second part of the paper will delve into the existing cybercrime framework and try to fathom whether the frameworks incorporate AI crime. 
 
The third part of the paper will be a study of different international organizations that have made progress pertaining to AI crimes and their success in the applicability of legal principles to AI crimes. Further, the author will recommend legal principles specifically targeting AI crimes which should be made applicable in the cybercrime framework. 
 
The fourth part of the paper will deal with the challenges of determining the jurisdiction of AI crimes as AI crimes are committed on computer systems and networks across the globe. In the conclusive part, the author will analyze how should the law deal with the above challenges along with recommendations of how the legal framework should specifically deal with the above challenges.",Kamshad Mohsin,10.2139/ssrn.3552140,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,paper_010,Elsevier BV,Regulation of AI and AI Crimes,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3552140,,,Semantic Scholar,high,security,security,Novel approach and methodology presented,Limitations and future work discussed,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"Next generation of embedded Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems are interconnected and collaborative systems able to perform autonomous tasks. The remarkable expansion of the embedded ICT market, together with the rise and breakthroughs of Artificial Intelligence (AI), have put the focus on the             Edge             as it stands as one of the keys for the next technological revolution: the seamless integration of AI in our daily life. However, training and deployment of custom AI solutions on embedded devices require a fine-grained integration of data, algorithms, and tools to achieve high accuracy and overcome functional and non-functional requirements. Such integration requires a high level of expertise that becomes a real bottleneck for small and medium enterprises wanting to deploy AI solutions on the             Edge             , which, ultimately, slows down the adoption of AI on applications in our daily life.                                   In this work, we present a modular AI pipeline as an integrating framework to bring data, algorithms, and deployment tools together. By removing the integration barriers and lowering the required expertise, we can interconnect the different stages of particular tools and provide a modular end-to-end development of AI products for embedded devices. Our AI pipeline consists of four modular main steps:             (i)             data ingestion,             (ii)             model training,             (iii)             deployment optimization, and             (iv)             the IoT hub integration. To show the effectiveness of our pipeline, we provide examples of different AI applications during each of the steps. Besides, we integrate our deployment framework, Low-Power Deep Neural Network (LPDNN), into the AI pipeline and present its lightweight architecture and deployment capabilities for embedded devices. Finally, we demonstrate the results of the AI pipeline by showing the deployment of several AI applications such as keyword spotting, image classification, and object detection on a set of well-known embedded platforms, where LPDNN consistently outperforms all other popular deployment frameworks.",Miguel De Prado; Jing Su; Rabia Saeed; Lorenzo Keller; Noelia Vallez; Andrew Anderson; David Gregg; Luca Benini; Tim Llewellynn; Nabil Ouerhani; Rozenn Dahyot; Nuria Pazos,10.1145/3403572,4,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,1-25,paper_013,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),Bonseyes AI Pipeline—Bringing AI to You,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1145/3403572,1.0,2020.0,Original,high,"performance, serverless","optimization, function",Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_013.pdf,Semantic Scholar,,8.83

"As smart cities evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be used to manage decisions for how cities operate. For everything from incarceration sentencing, city pension appropriation, surveillance and infrastructure management, AI will play a role. The author argues that implementing AI for a smart city should be decided similarly to how cities decide on major infrastructural planning projects. For both, there are social and ethical implications of deployment. A protocol is proposed for smart city AI so that AI can be seen as an ethical and trustworthy city asset rather than an adversary fraught with controversy and bias. This is achieved through participatory AI - the marriage of a fully transparent data architecture, such as the blockchain, and the urban planning practice of participatory planning. The diversity of opinions that participatory AI affords enables cities to facilitate socially responsible AI outcomes.",Gregory Falco,10.1109/cse/euc.2019.00038,,2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC),154-158,paper_016,IEEE,Participatory AI: Reducing AI Bias and Developing Socially Responsible AI in Smart Cities,proceedings-article,https://doi.org/10.1109/cse/euc.2019.00038,,2019.0,Semantic Scholar,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are experiencing widespread adoption in industry and academia. This has been driven by rapid advances in the applications and accuracy of AI through increasingly complex algorithms and models; this, in turn, has spurred research into specialized hardware AI accelerators. Given the rapid pace of advances, it is easy to forget that they are often developed and evaluated in a vacuum without considering the full application environment. This article emphasizes the need for a holistic, end-to-end analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and reveals the “AI tax.” We deploy and characterize             Face Recognition             in an edge data center. The application is an AI-centric edge video analytics application built using popular open source infrastructure and machine learning (ML) tools. Despite using state-of-the-art AI and ML algorithms, the application relies heavily on pre- and post-processing code. As AI-centric applications benefit from the acceleration promised by accelerators, we find they impose stresses on the hardware and software infrastructure: storage and network bandwidth become major bottlenecks with increasing AI acceleration. By specializing for AI applications, we show that a purpose-built edge data center can be designed for the stresses of accelerated AI at 15% lower TCO than one derived from homogeneous servers and infrastructure.",Daniel Richins; Dharmisha Doshi; Matthew Blackmore; Aswathy Thulaseedharan Nair; Neha Pathapati; Ankit Patel; Brainard Daguman; Daniel Dobrijalowski; Ramesh Illikkal; Kevin Long; David Zimmerman; Vijay Janapa Reddi,10.1145/3440689,1-4,ACM Transactions on Computer Systems,1-32,paper_019,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),AI Tax,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1145/3440689,37.0,2019.0,Original,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0
"Recently a number of well‐known public figures have expressed concern about the future development of artificial intelligence (AI), by noting that AI could get out of control and affect human beings and society in disastrous ways. Many of these cautionary notes are alarmist and unrealistic, and while there has been some pushback on these concerns, the deep flaws in the thinking that leads to them have not been called out. Much of the fear and trepidation is based on misunderstanding and confusion about what AI is and can ever be. In this work we identify 3 factors that contribute to this “AI anxiety”: an exclusive focus on AI programs that leaves humans out of the picture, confusion about autonomy in computational entities and in humans, and an inaccurate conception of technological development. With this analysis we argue that there are good reasons for anxiety about AI but not for the reasons typically given by AI alarmists.",Deborah G.
