"The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has shown impressive success in image synthesis. Artificial GAN-based synthesized images have been widely spread over the Internet with the advancement in generating naturalistic and photo-realistic images. This might have the ability to improve content and media; however, it also constitutes a threat with regard to legitimacy, authenticity, and security. Moreover, implementing an automated system that is able to detect and recognize GAN-generated images is significant for image synthesis models as an evaluation tool, regardless of the input modality. To this end, we propose a framework for reliably detecting AI-generated images from real ones through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). First, GAN-generated images were collected based on different tasks and different architectures to help with the generalization. Then, transfer learning was applied. Finally, several Class Activation Maps (CAM) were integrated to determine the discriminative regions that guided the classification model in its decision. Our approach achieved 100% on our dataset, i.e., Real or Synthetic Images (RSI), and a superior performance on other datasets and configurations in terms of its accuracy. Hence, it can be used as an evaluation tool in image generation. Our best detector was a pre-trained EfficientNetB4 fine-tuned on our dataset with a batch size of 64 and an initial learning rate of 0.001 for 20 epochs. Adam was used as an optimizer, and learning rate reduction along with data augmentation were incorporated.",Samah S. Baraheem; Tam V.

"Abstract           With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its pervasive integration into society, governments worldwide have introduced a range of AI-related policies. In the United States, the use of AI technology has surged significantly since 2021, driven by the emergence of generative AI and its transformative potential. In response, the U.S. Congress has proposed numerous AI-related bills, reflecting growing legislative engagement with AI governance. This study examines 204 AI-related bills introduced during the 117th and 118th Congresses (2021–2024) through computational text analysis, employing topic modeling to identify recurring legislative themes and sentiment analysis to assess congressional attitudes toward AI policies. The findings reveal distinct variations in legislative focus and tone across chambers and political parties, offering a nuanced understanding of how AI-related issues are framed within U.S. policymaking. In addition, the results highlight how AI is connected to broader opportunities and concerns, including national security, technological innovation, and public service delivery. By applying machine learning techniques to legislative texts, this research provides a systematic and scalable approach to understanding AI policymaking. The study contributes to broader discussions on the partisan and institutional dynamics shaping AI legislation in the United States, offering insights into how emerging technologies are shaped by legislative priorities, regulatory attitudes, and broader political contexts.",Heonuk Ha,10.1007/s00146-025-02466-9,,AI &amp; SOCIETY,,paper_003,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,When AI meets AI: analyzing AI bills using AI,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-025-02466-9,,2025,Original,high,security,security,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"Abstract                Subject area classification is an important first phase in the entire process involved in bibliometrics. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using automated algorithms for classifying scientific papers related to Artificial Intelligence at the document level. The current process is semimanual and journal based, a realization that, we argue, opens up the potential for inaccuracies. To counter this, our proposed automated approach makes use of neural networks, specifically BERT. The classification accuracy of our model reaches 96.5%. In addition, the model was used for further classifying documents from 26 different subject areas from the Scopus database. Our findings indicate that a significant subset of existing Computer Science, Decision Science, and Mathematics publications could potentially be classified as AI-related. The same holds in particular cases in other science fields such as Medicine and Psychology or Arts and Humanities. The above indicate that in subject area classification processes, there is room for automatic approaches to be utilized in a complementary manner with traditional manual procedures.",Evi Sachini; Konstantinos Sioumalas-Christodoulou; Stefanos Christopoulos; Nikolaos Karampekios,10.1162/qss_a_00223,4.0,Quantitative Science Studies,1119-1132,paper_005,MIT Press,AI for AI: Using AI methods for classifying AI science documents,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00223,3.0,2022,Original,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0
"This paper proposes that Artificial Intelligence (AI) progresses through several overlapping generations: AI 1.0 (Information AI), AI 2.0 (Agentic AI), AI 3.0 (Physical AI), and a speculative AI 4.0 (Conscious AI). Each AI generation is driven by shifting priorities among algorithms, computing power, and data. AI 1.0 accompanied breakthroughs in pattern recognition and information processing, fueling advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. AI 2.0 is built on these foundations through real-time decision-making in digital environments, leveraging reinforcement learning and adaptive planning for agentic AI applications. AI 3.0 extended intelligence into physical contexts, integrating robotics, autonomous vehicles, and sensor-fused control systems to act in uncertain real-world settings. Building on these developments, the proposed AI 4.0 puts forward the bold vision of self-directed AI capable of setting its own goals, orchestrating complex training regimens, and possibly exhibiting elements of machine consciousness. This paper traces the historical foundations of AI across roughly 70 years, mapping how changes in technological bottlenecks from algorithmic innovation to high-performance computing to specialized data have stimulated each generational leap. It further highlights the ongoing synergies among AI 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, and explores the ethical, regulatory, and philosophical challenges that arise when artificial systems approach (or aspire to) human-like autonomy. Ultimately, understanding these evolutions and their interdependencies is pivotal for guiding future research, crafting responsible governance, and ensuring that AI’s transformative potential benefits society.",Jiahao Wu; Hengxu You; Jing Du,10.3389/frai.2025.1585629,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,paper_006,Frontiers Media SA,AI generations: from AI 1.0 to AI 4.0,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2025.1585629,8.0,2025,Original,high,performance,performance,Novel approach and methodology presented,Limitations and future work discussed,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0
"The typical Integrated Circuit (IC) development process commences with formulating specifications in natural language and subsequently proceeds to Register Transfer Level (RTL) implementation. RTL code is traditionally generated through manual efforts, using Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as VHDL or Verilog. High-Level Synthesis (HLS), on the other hand, converts programming languages to HDL; these methods aim to streamline the engineering process, minimizing human effort and errors. Currently, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) algorithms have been improved with the use of AI, with new advancements in commercial (such as ChatGPT, Bard, among others) Large Language Models (LLM) and open-source tools presenting an opportunity to automate the chip design process. This paper centers on the creation of AI by AI, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) IC entirely developed by an LLM (ChatGPT-4), and its manufacturing with the first fabricable open-source Process Design Kit (PDK), SKY130A. The challenges, opportunities, advantages, disadvantages, conversation flow, and workflow involved in CNN IC development are presented in this work, culminating in the manufacturing process of AI by AI using a 130 nm technology, marking a groundbreaking achievement as possibly the world’s first CNN entirely written by AI for its IC manufacturing with a free PDK, being a benchmark for systems that can be generated today with LLMs.",Emilio Isaac Baungarten-Leon; Susana Ortega-Cisneros; Mohamed Abdelmoneum; Ruth Yadira Vidana Morales; German Pinedo-Diaz,10.3390/electronics13091704,9.0,Electronics,1704,paper_007,MDPI AG,The Genesis of AI by AI Integrated Circuit: Where AI Creates AI,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13091704,13.0,2024,Original,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Limitations and future work discussed,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"War games have played an essential role in the development of military force structures, strategies, operational concepts, and more. Military organizations are currently confronting uncertainties over the ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) may affect warfare at nearly every level, from combat tactics to operational concepts to force structure to deterrence and national and international security. This paper explores how game designers and players can approach questions regarding how AI may be employed in alternative contexts allowing for insight into how emerging and imagined technologies may affect warfare at many different levels of analysis. It identifies six application areas of AI technologies that games should consider—(1) principal–agent relations, (2) organizational and operational complexity, (3) attention management, (4) exploratory analysis, (5) information exploitation and model validation, and (6) adaptive behavior in open-ended systems—and suggests conceptual and practical strategies for investigating them in games that can be played in the absence of real-world systems and algorithms that perform these functions.",Aaron B Frank,10.1177/15485129221074352,1.0,"The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology",5-18,paper_009,SAGE Publications,Gaming AI without AI,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1177/15485129221074352,22.0,2025,Original,high,"security, serverless","security, function",Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"The emergence of widely-used artificial intelligence (AI) has created a critical need for AI expertise, not just as a research area but for workers in the wide variety of careers and roles that AI disrupts.  While AI is still an area of research for new processing, application, and development – it continues to partially automate, augment, or replace many of the tasks which are performed through active use of human hands.  While recently publicized items such as ChatGPT and MidJourney have made press in their adjustment to writing and image generation technology, the basic workflow of copyeditors and digital artists was completely transformed, inside of the year, to a combination of partially automated or fully automated AI tasks.  While some blame AI as part of the “problem”, it is naturally part of the “solution” – AI tools to help workers develop AI competencies.  The paper describes an array of strategies which the DoD and its ICT UARC are using to address the fundamental problem of quickly upskilling the DoD workforce of over 2 million adult learners.",Keith Brawner; Ning Wang; Ben Nye,10.32473/flairs.36.133388,,The International FLAIRS Conference Proceedings,,paper_012,University of Florida George A Smathers Libraries,Teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) with AI for AI applications,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.32473/flairs.36.133388,36.0,2023,Original,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_012.pdf,Semantic Scholar,,0.19

"The key specificity of Artificial Intelligence today is that it is a fast-evolving field with yet unknown capabilities and potential. In technical research as well as in media there are new emerging AI-related topics almost every day. We hear a lot about risks of AI but also about so many useful AI applications that help people and companies benefit from better lives or enhanced results of their activity. Businesses developing AI solutions worldwide face significant challenges not only in designing processes but also in putting on the market safe, efficient and reliable technologies. Thus, there is huge time pressure to set the necessary regulatory frame that will enable proper market functioning and encourage innovation in this area. On the other hand, there is considerable pressure from society to have a safe and trustworthy environment to use AI technology. Such expectations are only reasonable as AI development affects all the society and economy at all levels. Therefore, it’s important to identify the best regulatory option. Is there a need for binding rules and coercive state measures to regulate markets and social behavior? Or could the consensual technical requirements and ethical principles provide the necessary direction for a reasonable development, function and use of AI? This paper aims at formulating the most suitable regulatory framework to guide further development of AI. The two-step research methodology focuses on analyzing the incipient regulatory initiatives on AI, exploring the published articles in the area as well as the recently approved standards at international level. Based on this analysis authors will assess the pros and cons for the two regulatory options and will further elaborate the arguments for the best setting to regulate AI.",Iuliana ZAVATIN (CHILEA); Ioana Maria POPESCU (IACOBESCU); Rodica LUPU (ȘTEFĂNESCU); Andra-Elena ORLOSCHI,10.56043/reveco-2024-0030,3.0,Revista Economica,113-126,paper_015,Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,AI REGULATION VS.

"L’articolo intende proporre una prima riflessione sulle forme e sulle peculiarità delle lettere di dedica alla famiglia Farnese, spazio letterario imprescindibile per sondare la politica culturale della casata e, conseguentemente, le strategie di legittimazione. A partire da una prima ricognizione, è stato stilato un regesto, i cui estremi sono stati stabiliti fra il 1545, anno di fondazione del Ducato, e il 1628, anno in cui il giovane Odoardo divenne il quinto duca di Parma e Piacenza. Variamente interrogabile, questa mappatura consente di gettare luce sui poeti coinvolti, non tutti parte dello stretto entourage farnesiano, sui membri della famiglia più omaggiati, indizio forse di una maggiore inclinazione mecenatizia, sulle tipologie letterarie più gradite.

provide examples of models, systems, and applications. Based on that, we
introduce limitations of current generative AI and provide an agenda for

"Attempts to impose moral constraints on autonomous, artificial decision-making systems range from “human in the loop” requirements to specialized languages for machine-readable moral rules. Regardless of the approach, though, such proposals all face the challenge that moral standards are not universal. It is tempting to use lawfulness as a proxy for morality; unlike moral rules, laws are usually explicitly defined and recorded – and they are usually at least roughly compatible with local moral norms. However, lawfulness is a highly abstracted and, thus, imperfect substitute for morality, and it should be relied on only with appropriate caution. In this paper, we argue that law-abiding AI systems are a more achievable goal than moral ones. At the same time, we argue that it’s important to understand the multiple layers of abstraction, legal and algorithmic, that underlie even the simplest AI-enabled decisions. The ultimate output of such a system may be far removed from the original intention and may not comport with the moral principles to which it was meant to adhere. Therefore, caution is required lest we develop AI systems that are technically law-abiding but still enable amoral or immoral conduct.",Mason Kortz; Jessica Fjeld; Hannah Hilligoss; Adam Nagy,10.5771/2747-5174-2022-1-60,1.0,Morals &amp; Machines,60-65,paper_019,Nomos Verlag,Is Lawful AI Ethical AI?,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.5771/2747-5174-2022-1-60,2.0,2022,Original,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Limitations and future work discussed,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0
"Abstract           When artificial intelligence (AI) is used to make high-stakes decisions, some worry that this will create a morally troubling responsibility gap—that is, a situation in which nobody is morally responsible for the actions and outcomes that result. Since the responsibility gap might be thought to result from individuals lacking knowledge of the future behavior of AI systems, it can be and has been suggested that deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques will help us to avoid it. These techniques provide humans with certain forms of understanding of the systems in question. In this paper, I consider whether existing XAI techniques can indeed close the responsibility gap. I identify a number of significant limits to their ability to do so. Ensuring that responsibility for AI-assisted outcomes is maintained may require using different techniques in different circumstances, and potentially also developing new techniques that can avoid each of the issues identified.",Isaac Taylor,10.1007/s00146-024-01939-7,3.0,AI &amp; SOCIETY,1695-1704,paper_020,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Is explainable AI responsible AI?,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-024-01939-7,40.0,2025,Original,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_020.pdf,Semantic Scholar,,0.7
"A critical look at the evolution of AI strongly shows a sustained but stealth race to replace humans with AI. Early scientific literature and discourse on AI for some reasons (either to allow AI gain entry and acceptability in mainstream scientific and technological arena) vehemently deny this ""human replacement agenda"". This thinking pattern unknowingly shaped current scientific literature, discourse,  general understanding of what AI is and its development and applicability (a reductionist thinking). This limits our understanding in both the beneficial and destructive capabilities of AI. But when considering a TD assessment on the developmental dynamic of AI, one would comfortably say and must be bold to admit, that indeed AI intends replacing humans and is on course for fulfilling this.&#x0D;  &#x0D; We see this AI human replacement agenda in intensified R&amp;D efforts dedicated to developing powerful AI system of systems which massively augment human reasoning, most times far better. The inexhaustible list includes the AI replacement of formerly considered human-centric jobs, advanced autonomous weapon systems, killer robots and AI in warfare, intelligent facial recognition, biometric monitoring, integrating AI on biological, nuclear and space-based weapons systems, etc. If this is the direction AI is taking, then a secondary aim would surely arrive at integrating epistemology in AI or ""grant spirits"" for AI systems. This is because a distinctive characteristic of a human is his spirit and one cannot replace humans with AI without creating proportionate or appropriate spirits for the AI systems. Sooner or later our AI systems would have epistemological functions and possess spirits. The place of the soul for such AI systems would be attained as well. If human knowledge, beliefs, voices, clips and laws can be preserved long after they are gone as is possible in smart digital technologies, then spirit-based AI would indeed cause these humans to live forever. If the feat of a spirit enamored AI is near, then why worry? Indeed when considering that humans possess good and bad spirits (from the epistemology of rational and irrational inertia) then these AI systems would of course have good or bad spirits and be bad or good AI.&#x0D;  &#x0D; Would integrating a spirit into a rule-based or machine learning algorithmic structure of an AI system have benefits? Yes!, profound benefits too. A spirit-based AI would of course make possible the ""possession of feelings"" by AI systems, a feat unattainable in both algorithmic, operational and inferential basis of AI systems today. This inability of AI systems to have feelings has continued to remain a major setback in the acceptability (indeed trust) and utilization of AI. As we agree that the spirit in AI is possible, then overlooking efforts aimed at making this possible or allowing AI to attain this level unhindered (admitting dangers of human involvement in AI) could pose a dangerous threat which can become highly destructive to mankind. This calls for critical supervision (TD-based ethical policing) and the accompanying of the evolution, development and applicability of AI hence venerating the need for human mediation in AI both as a major TD research subject and applicable function.&#x0D;  &#x0D; A discussion would be made on my approach which considers the synergy of critical systems heuristics (CSH) and systems engineering (Transdisciplinary Systems Engineering) to create ""Transdisciplinary AI"" which would formulate methods of integrating ""human"" epistemology in expert systems. Human epistemology is emphasized because by the maturity of this future nature of AI, there would be terms known as ""AI or machine epistemology"" or ""AI or machine spirits"". The investigation begins with creating expert systems (knowledge-based systems) with these functions with plans of moving into robotics and other machine learning arena. Finally, to move the needle on what is considered permissible epistemology or permissible spirit of/in AI is a critical component of the study of human mediation and AI which must be given critical attention. This would be discussed as well.",Ndubuisi Idejiora-Kalu,10.22545/2024/00244,,Transdisciplinary Journal of Engineering &amp; Science,,paper_022,The Academy of Transdisciplinary Learning and Advanced Studies,Epistemology in AI (Transdisciplinary AI),journal-article,https://doi.org/10.22545/2024/00244,15.0,2024,Original,high,serverless,function,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0
"The future of cybersecurity will pit AI against AI. In this talk, we explore the role of AI in strengthening security defenses as well as the role of security in protecting AI services. We expect that the scale, scope and frequency of cyber attacks will increase disruptively with attackers harnessing AI to develop attacks that are even more targeted, sophisticated and evasive. At the same time, analysts in security operations centers are being increasingly overwhelmed in their efforts to keep up with the tasks of detecting, managing and responding to attacks. To cope, the security industry and practitioners are experimenting with the application of AI and machine learning technologies in different areas of security operations. These include a diverse set of areas such as detecting (mis)behaviors and malware, extracting and consolidating threat intelligence, reasoning over security alerts, and recommending countermeasures and/or protective measures. At the same time, adversarial attacks on machine learning systems have become an indisputable threat. Attackers can compromise the training of machine learning models by injecting malicious data into the training set (so-called poisoning attacks), or by crafting adversarial samples that exploit the blind spots of machine learning models at test time (so-called evasion attacks). Adversarial attacks have been demonstrated in a number of different application domains, including malware detection, spam filtering, visual recognition, speech-to-text conversion, and natural language understanding. Devising comprehensive defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks by adaptive adversaries is still an open challenge. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the threat by adversarial attacks and developing more effective defense systems and methods are paramount for the adoption of machine learning systems in security-critical real-world applications. The talk will provide an industrial research perspective and will cover research conducted at IBM Security Research over the several years.",Ian Molloy; Josyula R. Rao; Marc Ph.

"AbstractWhile there is a growing effort towards AI for Sustainability (e.g. towards the sustainable development goals) it is time to move beyond that and to address the sustainability of developing and using AI systems. In this paper I propose a definition of Sustainable AI; Sustainable AI is a movement to foster change in the entire lifecycle of AI products (i.e. idea generation, training, re-tuning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. As such, Sustainable AI is focused on more than AI applications; rather, it addresses the whole sociotechnical system of AI. I have suggested here that Sustainable AI is not about how to sustain the development of AI per say but it is about how to develop AI that is compatible with sustaining environmental resources for current and future generations; economic models for societies; and societal values that are fundamental to a given society. I have articulated that the phrase Sustainable AI be understood as having two branches; AI for sustainability and sustainability of AI (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions and computing power). I propose that Sustainable AI take sustainable development at the core of its definition with three accompanying tensions between AI innovation and equitable resource distribution; inter and intra-generational justice; and, between environment, society, and economy. This paper is not meant to engage with each of the three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such the pillars of sustainable AI. Rather, this paper is meant to inspire the reader, the policy maker, the AI ethicist, the AI developer to connect with the environment—to remember that there are environmental costs to AI. Further, to direct funding towards sustainable methods of AI.",Aimee van Wynsberghe,10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6,3.0,AI and Ethics,213-218,paper_025,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sustainable AI: AI for sustainability and the sustainability of AI,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6,1.0,2021,Original,high,cost,cost,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_025.pdf,Semantic Scholar,,0.57
"Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), researchers have asked how intelligent computing systems could interact with and relate to their users and their surroundings, leading to debates around issues of biased AI systems, ML black-box, user trust, user’s perception of control over the system, and system’s transparency, to name a few. All of these issues are related to how humans interact with AI or ML systems, through an interface which uses different interaction modalities. Prior studies address these issues from a variety of perspectives, spanning from understanding and framing the problems through ethics and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives to finding effective technical solutions to the problems. But what is shared among almost all those efforts is an assumption that if systems can explain the how and why of their predictions, people will have a better perception of control and therefore will trust such systems more, and even can correct their shortcomings. This research field has been called Explainable AI (XAI). In this studio, we take stock on prior efforts in this area; however, we focus on using Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI) as an interaction modality for understanding ML. We note that the affordances of physical forms and their behaviors potentially can not only contribute to the explainability of ML systems, but also can contribute to an open environment for criticism. This studio seeks to both critique explainable ML terminology and to map the opportunities that TEI can offer to the HCI for designing more sustainable, graspable and just intelligent systems.",Maliheh Ghajargar; Jeffrey Bardzell; Alison Smith Renner; Peter Gall Krogh; Kristina Höök; David Cuartielles; Laurens Boer; Mikael Wiberg,10.1145/3430524.3442704,,"Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction",1-4,paper_026,ACM,From ”Explainable AI” to ”Graspable AI”,proceedings-article,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430524.3442704,,2021,Semantic Scholar,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_026.pdf,Semantic Scholar,,0.45
"In this paper, we present the results achieved by performing a test addressed to evaluate the capabilities of the so-called AI content Detectors or AI Detection Systems. Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.",Mauro Coccoli; Gabriella Patanè,10.1109/rtsi61910.2024.10761124,,2024 IEEE 8th Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Innovation (RTSI),1-6,paper_027,IEEE,AI vs. AI: The Detection Game,proceedings-article,https://doi.org/10.1109/rtsi61910.2024.10761124,,2024,Semantic Scholar,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,False,,,All download strategies failed,0.0

"Following the rapid developing of artificial intelligence (AI) boosted by deep neural networks, we are wondering how far is it going for AI to be really creative. We know that human beings are intelligent in terms of creating novel things from scratch. Art can be selected as one type of Turing-Test : given two paintings, can we distinguish which one is painted by AI and which one is by a real-world person? This same question stands for music creating, poem writing, singing and so on. We further ask ourselves, can we be involved in the whole AI creation process? Say, we communicate with AI to exchange ideas of what’s the next painting topic or genre, or what’s the next movement of the music. Through these interactive AI creation processes, we hope to inspire AI and be inspired by AI, just alike we learn from Alpha-Go after it learnt from us first and then by itself through self-supervised learning. For Go gaming, we know the rules of win or lose. However, for AI creation, evaluation metrics are subjectively defined in creative ways. In this year’s (27th) Natural Language Processing (NLP 2021) conference, we proposed and organized the first workshop named “when creative AI meets conversational AI”, or, briefly “CAI+CAI=CAI”. In this one-day workshop, there are two technical papers and eight invited talks. These two technical papers respectively and interestingly cover one direction of text-toimage leveraging DM-GAN (Zhu et al. 2019) and ManiGAN (Li et al. 2020) for bird image generation (Azuaje et al. 2021) and its reversed direction of image-to-text by visual-text integrated Transformer (森 他 2021) for story generation. The eight invited talks cover most major directions of creative AI and conversational AI, such as voice conversion (Zhao et al. 2020), image generation (Jiang et al. 2021), contents retrieving (Yu et al. 2019), fine-art paintings (Huckle et al. 2020), image-to-image translation (Guo et al. 2021), AI painting, music generating and singing (Wu et al. 2020), poem-writing (Wu et al. 2017), and multi-modal learning for medical and healthcare applications (Ma et al. 2021; Obinata et al. 2020).",Xianchao Wu,10.5715/jnlp.28.881,3.0,Journal of Natural Language Processing,881-887,paper_029,Association for Natural Language Processing,When Creative AI Meets Conversational AI,journal-article,https://doi.org/10.5715/jnlp.28.881,28.0,2021,Semantic Scholar,high,others,,Novel approach and methodology presented,Not explicitly mentioned,True,/Users/reddy/2025/ResearchHelper/results/pdf/pdf/paper_029.pdf,Web Scraping,,0.18
"Based on the results of a qualitative study on how migrants experience technologies of automation in everyday life, the article describes users’ imaginaries of artificial intelligence as the overall technology behind different digital media applications. This encompasses the subjective idea of users about what AI technology is, what it can do, and what it should do. All respondents share a general understanding of AI as a feeling and awareness that the technology has its own logic of some kind, as articulated in recommendation algorithms on TikTok, YouTube or Netflix, language correction on WhatsApp or email programs, translation apps, but also in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Siri. By analytically linking the two concepts of AI imaginaries and AI literacy, a perspective is developed that focuses on culturally-shaped ideas about technology and the subjectively perceived agency is thus analyzed in the context of the technologies of automation.",Laura Sūna; Dagmar Hoffmann,10.7146/mk.v40i76.137144,76.0,MedieKultur: Journal of media and communication research,53-76,paper_030,Det Kgl.
