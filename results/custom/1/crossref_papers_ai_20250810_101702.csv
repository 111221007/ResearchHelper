paper_002,AI-Driven Performance Modeling for AI Inference Workloads,"Deep Learning (DL) is moving towards deploying workloads not only in cloud datacenters, but also to the local devices. Although these are mostly limited to inference tasks, it still widens the range of possible target architectures significantly. Additionally, these new targets usually come with drastically reduced computation performance and memory sizes compared to the traditionally used architectures—and put the key optimization focus on the efficiency as they often depend on batteries. To help developers quickly estimate the performance of a neural network during its design phase, performance models could be used. However, these models are expensive to implement as they require in-depth knowledge about the hardware architecture and the used algorithms. Although AI-based solutions exist, these either require large datasets that are difficult to collect on the low-performance targets and/or limited to a small number of target platforms and metrics. Our solution exploits the block-based structure of neural networks, as well as the high similarity in the typically used layer configurations across neural networks, enabling the training of accurate models on significantly smaller datasets. In addition, our solution is not limited to a specific architecture or metric. We showcase the feasibility of the solution on a set of seven devices from four different hardware architectures, and with up to three performance metrics per target—including the power consumption and memory footprint. Our tests have shown that the solution achieved an error of less than 1 ms (2.6%) in latency, 0.12 J (4%) in energy consumption and 11 MiB (1.5%) in memory allocation for the whole network inference prediction, while being up to five orders of magnitude faster than a benchmark.",Max Sponner; Bernd Waschneck; Akash Kumar,Electronics,2022,11,15,2316,MDPI AG,10.3390/electronics11152316,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11152316,journal-article

paper_004,Explainable AI improves task performance in human–AI collaboration,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) provides considerable opportunities to assist human work. However, one crucial challenge of human–AI collaboration is that many AI algorithms operate in a black-box manner where the way how the AI makes predictions remains opaque. This makes it difficult for humans to validate a prediction made by AI against their own domain knowledge. For this reason, we hypothesize that augmenting humans with explainable AI improves task performance in human–AI collaboration. To test this hypothesis, we implement explainable AI in the form of visual heatmaps in inspection tasks conducted by domain experts. Visual heatmaps have the advantage that they are easy to understand and help to localize relevant parts of an image. We then compare participants that were either supported by (a) black-box AI or (b) explainable AI, where the latter supports them to follow AI predictions when the AI is accurate or overrule the AI when the AI predictions are wrong. We conducted two preregistered experiments with representative, real-world visual inspection tasks from manufacturing and medicine. The first experiment was conducted with factory workers from an electronics factory, who performed $$N=9,600$$ assessments of whether electronic products have defects. The second experiment was conducted with radiologists, who performed $$N=5,650$$ assessments of chest X-ray images to identify lung lesions. The results of our experiments with domain experts performing real-world tasks show that task performance improves when participants are supported by explainable AI with heatmaps instead of black-box AI. We find that explainable AI as a decision aid improved the task performance by 7.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3% to 12.0%, $$P=0.001$$) in the manufacturing experiment and by 4.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.1% to 8.3%, $$P=0.010$$) in the medical experiment compared to black-box AI. These gains represent a significant improvement in task performance.",Julian Senoner; Simon Schallmoser; Bernhard Kratzwald; Stefan Feuerriegel; Torbjørn Netland,Scientific Reports,2024,14,1,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,10.1038/s41598-024-82501-9,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-82501-9,journal-article

paper_021,Designing Behavior-Aware AI to Improve the Human-AI Team Performance in AI-Assisted Decision Making,"With the rapid development of decision aids that are driven by AI models, the practice of AI-assisted decision making has become increasingly prevalent. To improve the human-AI team performance in decision making, earlier studies mostly focus on enhancing humans' capability in better utilizing a given AI-driven decision aid. In this paper, we tackle this challenge through a complementary approach—we aim to train ""behavior-aware AI"" by adjusting the AI model underlying the decision aid to account for humans' behavior in adopting AI advice. In particular, as humans are observed to accept AI advice more when their confidence in their own judgement is low, we propose to train AI models with a human-confidence-based instance weighting strategy, instead of solving the standard empirical risk minimization problem. Under an assumed, threshold-based model characterizing when humans will adopt the AI advice, we first derive the optimal instance weighting strategy for training AI models. We then validate the efficacy and robustness of our proposed method in improving the human-AI joint decision making performance through systematic experimentation on synthetic datasets. Finally, via randomized experiments with real human subjects along with their actual behavior in adopting the AI advice, we demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the decision making performance of the human-AI team in practice.",Syed Hasan Amin Mahmood; Zhuoran Lu; Ming Yin,Proceedings of the Thirty-ThirdInternational Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2024,,,3106-3114,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization,10.24963/ijcai.2024/344,https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2024/344,proceedings-article

paper_025,"Towards Ethical AI: Empirically Investigating Dimensions of AI Ethics, Trust Repair, and Performance in Human-AI Teaming","Objective Determining the efficacy of two trust repair strategies (apology and denial) for trust violations of an ethical nature by an autonomous teammate. Background While ethics in human-AI interaction is extensively studied, little research has investigated how decisions with ethical implications impact trust and performance within human-AI teams and their subsequent repair. Method Forty teams of two participants and one autonomous teammate completed three team missions within a synthetic task environment. The autonomous teammate made an ethical or unethical action during each mission, followed by an apology or denial. Measures of individual team trust, autonomous teammate trust, human teammate trust, perceived autonomous teammate ethicality, and team performance were taken. Results Teams with unethical autonomous teammates had significantly lower trust in the team and trust in the autonomous teammate. Unethical autonomous teammates were also perceived as substantially more unethical. Neither trust repair strategy effectively restored trust after an ethical violation, and autonomous teammate ethicality was not related to the team score, but unethical autonomous teammates did have shorter times. Conclusion Ethical violations significantly harm trust in the overall team and autonomous teammate but do not negatively impact team score. However, current trust repair strategies like apologies and denials appear ineffective in restoring trust after this type of violation. Application This research highlights the need to develop trust repair strategies specific to human-AI teams and trust violations of an ethical nature.",Beau G.

paper_034,Lossy DICOM conversion may affect AI performance,"Abstract Many pathologies have started to digitize their glass slides. To ensure long term accessibility, it is desirable to store them in the DICOM format. Currently, many scanners initially store the images in vendor-specific formats and only provide DICOM converters, with only a few producing DICOM directly. However, such a conversion is not lossless for all vendors, and in the case of MRXS files even overlapping tile handling differs. The resulting consequences have not yet been investigated. We converted MRXS files depicting bladder, ovarian and prostate tissue into DICOM images using the 3D Histech/Sysmex converter and an open-source tool both using baseline JPEG for the re-compression. After conversion no human perceptible differences were present between the images, nevertheless they were not identical and had structure similarity indices (SSIM) of ~ 0.85 to ~ 0.96 on average, while the vendor specific converter in general achieved higher values. AI models based on CNNs and current foundation models could distinguish between the original and the converted images in most cases with an accuracy of up to 99.5%. And already trained AI models showed significant performance differences between the image formats in five out of 64 scenarios, mainly when only little data was used during AI training. So, if DICOM images are intended for a diagnostic use, all processes and algorithms must be (re-)evaluated with the converted files, as images are not identical. Nevertheless, the DICOM format is an excellent opportunity to ensure interoperability in future, as some first AI trainings with converted files did not result in systematically decreased performances.",Robin Sebastian Mayer; Fabian Fliedner; Ingvild Frøberg Mathisen; Anna Laib; Julia Bein; Marco Eichelberg; Peter J.

paper_038,Student Performance Prediction using AI and ML,"Abstract: As we all know that due to this pandemic situation many problems had been faced in the education stream. As we saw that the most of the students got good marks and on the other hand most students got lesser or average marks. In Critical case the good students got average marks or lesser then there expectations. As a result, all students got the admission but if the person is not that capable but taking admission to that college due to good result .So it seems unfair so to resolve this loophole, we decided to build a software for student performance prediction. It is an important desire in most of the educational departments and institutes to predict the student’s performance. Machine Learning algorithm and descriptive datasets include school, Sex, Age, Address, Family size, P status, M education, F education, M job, F job, Reason, Guardians, Travel time, Study time, Failures, School sup, Family sup, Activities, Free time, Go out, Health, attendance. We have been considered that the prediction and classification of student performance respectively using three type of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, ANN, XG Boost are implemented to predict the student’s academic performance. The prediction based models are created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the year each. The analysis of demographical attributes release that they are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.

paper_049,"AI-Powered Renal Diet Support: Performance of ChatGPT, Bard AI, and Bing Chat","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) necessitate specialized renal diets to prevent complications such as hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. A comprehensive assessment of food components is pivotal, yet burdensome for healthcare providers. With evolving artificial intelligence (AI) technology, models such as ChatGPT, Bard AI, and Bing Chat can be instrumental in educating patients and assisting professionals. To gauge the efficacy of different AI models in discerning potassium and phosphorus content in foods, four AI models—ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, Bard AI, and Bing Chat—were evaluated. A total of 240 food items, curated from the Mayo Clinic Renal Diet Handbook for CKD patients, were input into each model. These items were characterized by their potassium (149 items) and phosphorus (91 items) content. Each model was tasked to categorize the items into high or low potassium and high phosphorus content. The results were juxtaposed with the Mayo Clinic Renal Diet Handbook’s recommendations. The concordance between repeated sessions was also evaluated to assess model consistency. Among the models tested, ChatGPT 4 displayed superior performance in identifying potassium content, correctly classifying 81% of the foods. It accurately discerned 60% of low potassium and 99% of high potassium foods. In comparison, ChatGPT 3.5 exhibited a 66% accuracy rate. Bard AI and Bing Chat models had an accuracy rate of 79% and 81%, respectively. Regarding phosphorus content, Bard AI stood out with a flawless 100% accuracy rate. ChatGPT 3.5 and Bing Chat recognized 85% and 89% of the high phosphorus foods correctly, while ChatGPT 4 registered a 77% accuracy rate. Emerging AI models manifest a diverse range of accuracy in discerning potassium and phosphorus content in foods suitable for CKD patients. ChatGPT 4, in particular, showed a marked improvement over its predecessor, especially in detecting potassium content. The Bard AI model exhibited exceptional precision for phosphorus identification. This study underscores the potential of AI models as efficient tools in renal dietary planning, though refinements are warranted for optimal utility.",Ahmad Qarajeh; Supawit Tangpanithandee; Charat Thongprayoon; Supawadee Suppadungsuk; Pajaree Krisanapan; Noppawit Aiumtrakul; Oscar A.

paper_050,Edge AI vs Cloud AI: A Comparative Study of Performance Latency and Scalability,"The increasing need for real-time decision-making and low-latency processing in AI applications has created interest in the comparative study of Edge AI and Cloud AI. Cloud AI, with its high computational power and scalability, has been the choice for data-intensive applications. But with the introduction of IoT devices and the growing need for instant data processing, Edge AI, which processes data locally on devices close to the data source, has become a potential alternative. This shift in paradigm, however, introduces new challenges in balancing the computational power of edge devices with the processing and storage of cloud infrastructure. Despite the extensive amount of work in Edge and Cloud AI, to this point, there has been limited documentation in the form of an end-to-end literature that investigates the trade-offs in the performance, latency, and scalability of Edge and Cloud AI across a wide range of applications. Although Edge AI excels in latency reduction through compressing data transfer time, it generally does not have scalability and computational power, especially in handling complex AI models. On the other hand, Cloud AI excels in scalability and resource-intensive tasks but is limited by latency constraints on data transfer. This work tries to fill this gap by comparatively evaluating the strengths and limitations of Edge AI and Cloud AI, i.e., performance, scalability, and latency, in different application fields like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and industrial IoT. The research points toward the predominance of hybrid systems combining Edge and Cloud AI to combat these limitations and provide a balanced solution to new AI applications.",Vishesh Narendra Pamadi; Pushpa Singh,International Journal of Research in Modern Engineering &amp; Emerging Technology,2025,13,3,13-35,Resagate Global,10.63345/ijrmeet.org.v13.i3.2,https://doi.org/10.63345/ijrmeet.org.v13.i3.2,journal-article
