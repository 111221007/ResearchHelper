paper_009,Serverless Java: Cold Start Mitigation in Cloud Run/Spring Boot,"This paper focuses on the cold start latency problem in serverless Java applications, seen mainly when deploying with Google Cloud Run and Spring Boot. Auto-scaling, reduced infrastructure use, and cost savings are why serverless computing is becoming more popular. Still, Java applications generally face delays when starting up, referred to as cold starts, because the JVM must boot up, and Spring Boot comprises complex settings. Because of this latency, users' experience can become very poor, especially when using real-time APIs, chatbots, and e-commerce systems. The study explains the processes behind cold starts, their impact, and several ways to address them. Cloud Run's usage of containers and Spring Boot being a good choice for creating microservices is covered, as well as their difficulties in initializing quickly. Optimizations include adjusting container images, native compilation using GraalVM, setting ""minimum instances"" and concurrency in Cloud Run, using lazy initialization in Spring Boot, and routinely pinging during warm-up. These approaches have been observed to improve latency from several seconds to almost nothing whenever they are used. This research uses case analysis, benchmarking, and performance monitoring to examine the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The paper concludes that although Java encounters some cold start difficulties, recent advancements in tools such as GraalVM, virtual machine design, and better cloud support are promising. If Java is configured correctly and sufficient time is spent planning, it can be an excellent fit for serverless environments on Google Cloud Run.",Sandeep Reddy Gundla,International journal of IoT,2025,05,01,126-145,European International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Management Studies,10.55640/ijiot-05-01-07,https://doi.org/10.55640/ijiot-05-01-07,journal-article

paper_015,Intelligent Workload Readjustment of Serverless Functions in Cloud to Edge Environment,"Serverless technologies have represented a significant advancement in cloud computing, characterized by its exceptional scalability and the granular subscription-based model provided by leading public cloud vendors. Concurrently, serverless platforms that facilitate the FaaS architecture enable users to use numerous benefits while functioning on the on-site infrastructures of enterprises. It makes it possible to install and use them on several tiers of the cloud-to-edge continuum, from IoT devices at the user end to on-site clusters near to the main sources or directly in the Cloud. The challenges caused by varying data input rates on low-powered gadgets at the user-end layers are addressed in this work in two ways. It offers an event-driven, open-source file handling system designed to dynamically distribute and rearrange serverless operations throughout the cloud-to-edge spectrum. A fire detection use case illustrates the efficacy of these techniques, utilizing small Kubernetes clusters at the Edge for Fog-level processing, on-premises elastic clusters for private cloud computing, and AWS Lambda for cloud computing execution. Findings demonstrate that coordinated multi-layer computing markedly diminishes system overload, hence improving performance in distributed cloud systems.","Srikanth Yerra Ups,USA",International journal of data science and machine learning,2025,05,01,182-191,European International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Management Studies,10.55640/ijdsml-05-01-18,https://doi.org/10.55640/ijdsml-05-01-18,journal-article

paper_018,Startup Latency Analysis in Java Frameworks for Serverless AWS Lambda Deployments.,"Cold start latency in serverless computing, particularly in Java-based AWS Lambda functions, presents a significant challenge for latency-sensitive applications. This study investigates the performance characteristics of three modern Java frameworks - Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Quarkus - deployed on AWS Lambda using the ARM64 (Graviton2) architecture. It evaluates cold start latency across three deployment configurations: managed runtime (with and without SnapStart) and GraalVM native images. Metrics were collected at varying memory allocations using Java 21. Results show that Quarkus consistently outperforms others in cold start latency on standard JVM, while SnapStart and GraalVM significantly reduce the number of cold starts and achieve sub-second latency, respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for choosing a Java framework and runtime strategy on AWS Lambda, considering the trade-offs in deployment time, complexity, and performance. The paper concludes with recommendations for leveraging SnapStart and native images to mitigate cold start issues in Java serverless applications on ARM64.",Maksimov Viacheslav Yurievich,The American Journal of Engineering and Technology,2025,07,04,16-21,The USA Journals,10.37547/tajet/volume07issue04-03,https://doi.org/10.37547/tajet/volume07issue04-03,journal-article

paper_021,Reducing Environmental Impact with Sustainable Serverless Computing,"Serverless computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm in cloud computing, offering scalability, cost efficiency, and potential environmental benefits. By abstracting infrastructure management and enabling on-demand resource allocation, serverless computing minimizes idle resource consumption and reduces operational overhead. This paper critically examines the sustainability implications of serverless computing, evaluating its impact on energy efficiency, resource utilization, and carbon emissions through empirical studies and a survey of cloud professionals. Our findings indicate that serverless computing significantly reduces energy consumption by up to 70% and operational costs by up to 60%, reinforcing its role in green IT initiatives. However, real-world deployments face challenges such as cold-start latency and workload-dependent inefficiencies, which impact overall sustainability benefits. To address these challenges, we propose strategic recommendations, including fine-grained function decomposition, energy-efficient cloud provider selection, and AI-driven resource management. Additionally, we highlight discrepancies between empirical research and practitioner experiences, emphasizing the need for optimized architectures in order to fully harness the sustainability potential of serverless computing.

paper_028,Test Automation for Serverless Architectures (FaaS),"Serverless architectures, and specifically Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), represent a paradigm shift in application development, offering compelling benefits such as automatic scaling, a pay-per-use cost model, and significantly reduced operational management of underlying infrastructure. This architectural style allows developers to focus on writing business logic in ephemeral, event-triggered functions. However, these very characteristics—distributed components, statelessness, reliance on a multitude of managed cloud services, and the event-driven execution model—introduce unique and complex challenges for traditional software testing methodologies. Ensuring the reliability, performance, security, and correctness of these highly decoupled systems necessitates a robust and tailored approach to test automation. This document provides an in-depth exploration of the critical role test automation plays in the serverless ecosystem. It meticulously examines strategies for designing and implementing automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests specifically for FaaS applications. Key considerations such as effective mocking of event sources and dependent services, managing distributed state for testing, validating complex event-driven workflows, and choosing appropriate tools and frameworks are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the document outlines best practices for constructing resilient and efficient automated testing pipelines that integrate seamlessly with CI/CD processes, enabling agile development and the consistent delivery of high-quality serverless solutions.

paper_032,Optimizing Multitenancy: Adaptive Resource Allocation in Serverless Cloud Environments Using Reinforcement Learning,"The growing adoption of serverless computing has highlighted critical challenges in resource allocation, policy fairness, and energy efficiency within multitenancy cloud environments. This research proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive resource allocation framework to address these issues. The framework models resource allocation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with dynamic states that include latency, resource utilization, and energy consumption. A reward function is designed to optimize the throughput, latency, and energy efficiency while ensuring fairness among tenants. The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over heuristic approaches, achieving a 50% reduction in latency (from 250 ms to 120 ms), a 38.9% increase in throughput (from 180 tasks/s to 250 tasks/s), and a 35% improvement in energy efficiency. Additionally, the model reduces operational costs by 40%, achieves SLA compliance rates above 98%, and enhances fairness by lowering the Gini coefficient from 0.25 to 0.10. Under burst loads, the system maintains a service level objective success rate of 94% with a time to scale of 6 s.

paper_036,Potential of Serverless Edge-powered Islands for Web Development,"Web developers face two significant challenges when developing their applications and websites: latency and payload size. Given that web services rely on servers, the related communication incurs a cost in terms of latency. In contrast, the payload passed to the client incurs a communication cost, not to mention the computational cost to the client. The concept of serverless edge computing, built on top of content delivery networks (CDNs), is an approach that has begun to gain the attention of web developers for its promise of lower latencies due to its efficiencies in communication thanks to globally distributed networks and replication. Islands architecture is a technical approach that addresses payload size by giving developers easy ways to defer and potentially even avoid the cost of loading content. Combined, these two approaches form edge-powered islands and, in this article, we examine how the combination can help to address these two notable costs web developers have to consider in their daily work. Our findings indicate that edge-powered islands can provide a way to introduce interactivity to otherwise static websites while wrapping dynamic portions of a page within islands to gain the benefits of static approaches in more dynamic contexts, such as storefronts. In addition, islands can provide loading benefits even for more application-like websites, such as social networks, and give web developers an additional control layer in their development work.",Juho Vepsäläinen; Petri Vuorimaa; Arto Hellas,Journal of Web Engineering,2025,,,,River Publishers,10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2411,https://doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2411,journal-article

The convergence of serverless computing paradigms with permissioned blockchain technologies presents a transformative solution that addresses these critical limitations through innovative architectural frameworks. Serverless computing eliminates infrastructure provisioning burdens while enabling dynamic resource scaling that automatically responds to transaction volume fluctuations. This architectural evolution demonstrates remarkable adaptability during varying demand periods, seamlessly transitioning between minimal resource consumption and extensive parallel processing capabilities. Blockchain integration enhances these capabilities through immutable transaction records, cryptographic verification mechanisms, and distributed consensus validation protocols that ensure comprehensive security guarantees. The synthesis creates hybrid payment infrastructures capable of executing settlement operations with cryptographic security assurances while preserving elastic scaling characteristics inherent to cloud-native implementations. Performance benchmarking reveals exceptional improvements in transaction throughput, processing latency, and operational efficiency compared to traditional architectures.

paper_046,Optimizing Serverless Computing,"Abstract—Serverless computing abstracts infrastructure man- agement, hence provides scalability and cost-effectiveness. Per- formance bottlenecks related to this architecture include cold starts, resource inefficiency, and increased latency of execution. Strategies for optimizing serverless computing would involve con- tainer pooling and AI-based scheduling, to add to the resource- aware function execution and blockchain implementation ap- proaches. On an OpenFaaS and AWS Lambda platform, the above-proposed model realizes 40% lower cold-start latency and 25% less execution cost. The paper will further explore adaptive scaling-both for warming the cache and decentralized computation with load balancing added to further increase efficiency with multiple clouds. This research also introduces the possibility of blockchain-based serverless execution as an application that maintains security as well as transparency in computation processes.
