paper_001,Startup Latency Analysis in Java Frameworks for Serverless AWS Lambda Deployments.,"Cold start latency in serverless computing, particularly in Java-based AWS Lambda functions, presents a significant challenge for latency-sensitive applications. This study investigates the performance characteristics of three modern Java frameworks - Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Quarkus - deployed on AWS Lambda using the ARM64 (Graviton2) architecture. It evaluates cold start latency across three deployment configurations: managed runtime (with and without SnapStart) and GraalVM native images. Metrics were collected at varying memory allocations using Java 21. Results show that Quarkus consistently outperforms others in cold start latency on standard JVM, while SnapStart and GraalVM significantly reduce the number of cold starts and achieve sub-second latency, respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for choosing a Java framework and runtime strategy on AWS Lambda, considering the trade-offs in deployment time, complexity, and performance. The paper concludes with recommendations for leveraging SnapStart and native images to mitigate cold start issues in Java serverless applications on ARM64.",Maksimov Viacheslav Yurievich,The American Journal of Engineering and Technology,2025,07,04,16-21,The USA Journals,10.37547/tajet/volume07issue04-03,https://doi.org/10.37547/tajet/volume07issue04-03,journal-article

paper_009,Latency-Sensitive Function Placement among Heterogeneous Nodes in Serverless Computing,"Function as a Service (FaaS) is highly beneficial to smart city infrastructure due to its flexibility, efficiency, and adaptability, specifically for integration in the digital landscape. FaaS has serverless setup, which means that an organization no longer has to worry about specific infrastructure management tasks; the developers can focus on how to deploy and create code efficiently. Since FaaS aligns well with the IoT, it easily integrates with IoT devices, thereby making it possible to perform event-based actions and real-time computations. In our research, we offer an exclusive likelihood-based model of adaptive machine learning for identifying the right place of function. We employ the XGBoost regressor to estimate the execution time for each function and utilize the decision tree regressor to predict network latency. By encompassing factors like network delay, arrival computation, and emphasis on resources, the machine learning model eases the selection process of a placement. In replication, we use Docker containers, focusing on serverless node type, serverless node variety, function location, deadlines, and edge-cloud topology. Thus, the primary objectives are to address deadlines and enhance the use of any resource, and from this, we can see that effective utilization of resources leads to enhanced deadline compliance.",Urooba Shahid; Ghufran Ahmed; Shahbaz Siddiqui; Junaid Shuja; Abdullateef Oluwagbemiga Balogun,Sensors,2024,24,13,4195,MDPI AG,10.3390/s24134195,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24134195,journal-article

paper_017,"Cold Start Latency in Serverless Computing: A Systematic Review, Taxonomy, and Future Directions","Recently, academics and the corporate sector have paid attention to serverless computing, which enables dynamic scalability and an economic model. In serverless computing, users only pay for the time they actually use resources, enabling zero scaling to optimise cost and resource utilisation. However, this approach also introduces the serverless cold start problem. Researchers have developed various solutions to address the cold start problem, yet it remains an unresolved research area. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review on cold start latency in serverless computing. Furthermore, we create a detailed taxonomy of approaches to cold start latency, which we use to investigate existing techniques for reducing the cold start time and frequency. We have classified the current studies on cold start latency into several categories such as caching and application-level optimisation-based solutions, as well as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning-based solutions. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of cold start latency on quality of service, explored current cold start latency mitigation methods, datasets, and implementation platforms, and classified them into categories based on their common characteristics and features. Finally, we outline the open challenges and highlight the possible future directions.",Muhammed Golec; Guneet Kaur Walia; Mohit Kumar; Felix Cuadrado; Sukhpal Singh Gill; Steve Uhlig,ACM Computing Surveys,2025,57,3,1-36,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),10.1145/3700875,https://doi.org/10.1145/3700875,journal-article
