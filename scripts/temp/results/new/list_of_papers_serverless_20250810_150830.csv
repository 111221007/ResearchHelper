paper_001,A Study of Triggering Serverless Functions in Serverless Environment,"Serverless computing has gained significant popularity due to its ability to provide scalable and cost-efficient cloud services. However, the adoption of serverless functions comes with its own set of challenges. One critical aspect is the triggering mechanism that initiates the execution of serverless functions in a serverless environment. This research paper explores the various triggering-related issues that can arise when deploying serverless functions and proposes potential solutions to mitigate these problems. The paper also highlights the importance of trigger design and its impact on the overall performance and reliability of serverless applications.","Shashank Srivastava, Bineet Kumar Gupta",Tuijin Jishu/Journal of Propulsion Technology,2023,44,2,,Science Research Society,10.52783/tjjpt.v44.i2.990,https://doi.org/10.52783/tjjpt.v44.i2.990,journal-article
